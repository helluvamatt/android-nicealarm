Nice Alarm
==========

Nice Alarm is my free, open source solution to a nicer alarm clock for your phone. Samsung phones already have this feature, and when I switched to an HTC phone, I missed the soothing alarm clock. So, I decided to write my own solution and release it open source.

How It Works
------------

You set an alarm time (what time the regular alarm should go off) and a "pre-alarm". This pre-alarm plays a soft, soothing audio track for a few minutes leading up to the actual alarm so you can wake up in line with your natural sleep cycle. Personally, I have noticed this sort of alarm clock makes me wake up feeling like a had a full night's sleep.

Features
--------
* Set the length of the pre-alarm (how long before the actual alarm time the pre-alarm tune starts playing.)
* Set the pre-alarm audio track (a few built-in options will be available)
* Set the actual alarm audio track
